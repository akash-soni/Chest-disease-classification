Ques : What is Python-Box
Ans : for directly writing exceptions without creating custom exceptions.


Ques : What is config box
Ans :  Suppose we want to access a dictionary object 
       EX : data['name'] , this will return the name 
       but Suppose if we want to access like this

       data.name then we will get the error, but this is more conveninent approach


       to fix such we use config box. Check trials.ipynb
          

Ques :  What is Ensure annotations?
Ans :  Consider function
 
        def get_product(x:int, y:int):
            return x*y

        get_product(x=4, y=5)  will return 20
        get_product(x=4, y="5") will return 5555 which is wrong 

        If we use ensure annotations then

        @ensure_annotations
        def get_product(x:int, y:int):
            return x*y

        get_product(x=4, y=5)  will return 20
        get_product(x=4, y="5") will return error

        Here it will not allow string value to get passed into integer.

        This is mainly used to write production quality code .

Ques : Why logs inside the utils constructor file?
Ans : we can write logger inside a seperate file but we will have to initialize the import path

      EX : from cnnClassifier.loggings import logger

      but if we directly write inside the constructor then we will not have to write seperely
      we can directly import with the name of our packge

      EX : from cnnClassifier import logger



Ques : What is MLFLOW?
Ans : for Experiment tracking purpose

      supp are doing experiment with models

      Experiment 1
      Elastic Net  --> Alpha = 0.7, L1 Ration= 0.9 --> Accuracy 70%

      Experiment 2
      Elastic Net  --> Alpha = 0.5, L1 Ration= 0.5 --> Accuracy 80%

      Experiment 3
      Elastic Net  --> Alpha = 0.4, L1 Ration= 0.6 --> Accuracy 50%
      .
      .
      .
      Experiment 10


      We will save result of all the Experiments in a CSV file and then do the manual observation

      But using MLFLOW functionality call experiment tracking we can directly observe which
      models is performing the best. 
      It creates a mlruns directory which contains all the experiment results which we can use for model comparision.
      


      Practicle:
      - Using local MLFLOW setup, it will create a mlruns directory which will contains all Experiments. Check mlflow_demo.Python
      -
